## How Distill Leverages Hatchet to Streamline Data Processing and Enhance AI Capabilities

Distill is an AI startup specializing in comprehensive research on individuals and companies to empower sales, recruiting, and more.

### Pain Before

Distill was managing its own multi-stage pipeline system for processing data, scraping, and AI, which required significant effort to build internal tools for inspecting, debugging, and replaying pipeline steps. This approach was cumbersome and resource-intensive.

Additionally, managing a background job processing system posed challenges with timeouts, retries, error handling, backpressure, and fairness---even when utilizing tools like RabbitMQ or BullMQ.

## Solution

Distill adopted Hatchet to simplify and enhance workflow management:

- **Hatchet's Dashboard Tools**: Provides the ability to instantly identify issues by viewing failures, logs, and outputs for every workflow step, eliminating the need to maintain custom inspection tools.
- Complex Dag Visualization: Provides a clear visual representation of the workflow, making it easier to understand and debug.
- Background Job Management: Simplifies the management and retrying of background jobs with easy concurrency primitives and robust alerting mechanisms, removing the burden of maintaining complex infrastructure.

## Outcome

With Hatchet, Distill achieved significant improvements:

- Enabled rapid debugging of output issues, saving hundreds of engineering hours previously spent on maintaining internal tools.
- Streamlined background job processing, allowing the team to focus on core activities instead of managing infrastructure.

Overall, integrating Hatchet led to a more efficient, reliable, and scalable system, enhancing Distill's ability to deliver detailed and accurate profiles to users.

## What Distill Loves ❤️

- Hatchet operates seamlessly both locally for engineers and in production, facilitating smooth local iterations and effective production issue debugging.
- Hatchet is "just code," avoiding vendor lock-in and supporting multiple programming languages, providing flexibility and control.
- Adding new steps to workflows is effortless, even as pipeline complexity increases.
- Advanced features like webhooks, serverless functions, and scheduled workflows enable the incorporation of increasingly complex logic into Hatchet.
- The ability to view logs and outputs at each workflow stage is impressive and serves as an excellent demonstration tool for engineering candidates.
- Structuring profile generation as a sequence of stages with clear outputs has made the overall process more debuggable, testable, and reliable, contributing to a better-designed system.
